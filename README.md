# 🤖 30 AI Agents in 30 Days

Build 30 real-world AI agents in 30 days — exploring Agentic AI, RAG, tool usage, memory, orchestration, and production-grade AI system design.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents a structured challenge to design and implement **30 independent AI agents**, each focused on a unique real-world use case or architectural concept.

The goal is to deeply explore how modern AI agents:

- Reason step-by-step  
- Use tools dynamically  
- Maintain memory  
- Retrieve external knowledge  
- Execute multi-step workflows  
- Operate in production-style environments  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build 30 functional AI agents
- Explore diverse agent architectures
- Implement real-world AI automation use cases
- Understand system-level AI design patterns
- Create a structured AI engineering portfolio

---

## 🧠 Concepts Explored

Across the 30 agents, the following areas are covered:

### Agent Architectures
- Single-tool agents
- Multi-tool agents
- Planner–Executor systems
- Hierarchical agents
- Multi-agent collaboration

### Core Capabilities
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Dynamic tool calling
- Short-term and long-term memory
- Context management
- Self-reflection and iterative reasoning
- Guardrails & safety constraints

### System-Level Engineering
- Observability & logging
- Evaluation frameworks
- Failure handling & retries
- Rate limiting & cost optimization
- Scalability considerations
