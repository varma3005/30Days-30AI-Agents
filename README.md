🤖 30 AI Agents in 30 Days
Exploring Agentic AI – One Agent at a Time 🚀

Welcome to my personal challenge:

Build 30 AI Agents in 30 Days
Each agent explores a different concept in Agentic AI, tools, memory, reasoning, orchestration, and real-world automation.

This repository documents my journey of designing, building, and experimenting with autonomous AI systems.

🎯 Why This Challenge?

The future of AI is not just LLMs —
It’s Agents that can think, decide, use tools, remember, and act.

This challenge helps me:

Deeply understand Agentic AI architectures

Experiment with real-world use cases

Explore tool calling, RAG, memory, orchestration

Learn frameworks like Google ADK, LangChain, MCP

Build production-style AI systems

🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems can:

Plan tasks

Reason step-by-step

Call tools dynamically

Maintain memory

Interact with APIs

Execute multi-step workflows

Self-correct

This project explores all of that — practically.

🏗️ Core Concepts Covered

Across 30 days, I’ll explore:

🔹 Single-Tool Agents

🔹 Multi-Tool Orchestration

🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🔹 Memory-based Agents

🔹 API-integrated Agents

🔹 Workflow Automation Agents

🔹 MCP (Model Context Protocol) based systems

🔹 AgenticOps concepts

🔹 Evaluation & Observability

🔹 Guardrails & Safety

🛠️ Tech Stack

Depending on the agent, I’ll experiment with:

Language: Python / Node.js

Frameworks: Google ADK, LangChain, Custom Orchestration

LLMs: Gemini, GPT, Open Models

Vector Stores: FAISS, Chroma

Embeddings: Model-based embeddings

Protocols: MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Deployment: Local, Cloud-based
